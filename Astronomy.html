     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Hello everyone!
    This is an intoduction to Intoduction to Astronomy. As described in the syllabus In this course, we will explore our current knowledge of the universe by understanding how weâ€™ve come to know what we know through a science- and evidence-based worldview.  Through our journey, we will encounter astrophysical topics of interest while developing an appreciation of the scientific process.  We will work together to emerge as scientifically literate citizens through the lens of astronomy, while putting into perspective the necessity for such citizenry.  In the end, you will leave this course with a background in astrophysics and with the ability to think critically, logically, and with reason.</p></br>
