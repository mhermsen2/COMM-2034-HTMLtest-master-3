     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Hello everyone!
     This is an introduction to Topics in Feminism. As described in the course syllabus, created by my professor Dr. Zare. She lists out the course objectives. </p>
     <p> At the end of the semester, students will enhance their understanding of answers to the following questions: </p></br>
     <ol>
       <li> 1. What are the limitations of using “sisterhood is global” as a foundation? How do Western feminists avoid a “save the woman” discourse? </li> </br>
       <li>   2. In the realm of religion, the economy, and education, what kinds of ideas about gender appear and how do they change? </li> </br>
       <li> 3. How do feminist theory and practice respond to change? </li> </br>
       <li>4. What do effective artistic and musical protests add to the public conversation? </li> </br>
       <li> 5. What are dilemmas, possibilities, and strategies of feminism in different geographic areas? </li> </br>
       <p> Our course will move through a group of themes, considering events and debates in different countries. There is a special emphasis on India, one of the most internally diverse regions of the world and the second most populous country in the world.</p></br>
       <p> This is a seminar-style course in which the work centers on readings and in-depth discussion. Time is set aside to help form and maintain a supportive learning community because that is a better environment for students to extend their knowledge and build on a variety of skills.</p>
