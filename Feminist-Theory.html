     <h1>Welcome</h1>
     <p>Hello everyone!
     Welcome to my Feminist Theory class. The reason I chose to take this class during my fall semester is because I am a Women's and Gender Studies minor. I am really interested in Women's history and where we are now in terms of progression in todays society. </p>
     <br/>
     <h2> Course Description and Obejectives </h2> </br>
     <br/> This course provides you with key terms and concepts in the field of Women’s and Gender Studies. Our class examines feminist theoretical texts and engages with social issues and creative work from an array of feminist theoretical perspectives.<br/>
     <br/> <ul> This class will: <br/>
       <br/> <li> -familiarize students with the depth, breadth and variety of feminist theories as the result of the cultural and historical contexts in which they emerged </li>
       <br/> <li> -enable students to separate different theoretical ideas and analyze how they complement or contradict each other </li>
       <br/> <li> -consider how a feminist theory used as a framework may help to effectively communicate information about socio-political issues </li>
